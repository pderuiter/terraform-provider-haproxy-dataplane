# haproxy-dataplane_backend (Data Source)

Use this data source to read backend configuration that already exists.

## Example Usage

Use this to reference existing HAProxy objects that are managed outside Terraform or in a separate workspace.

```terraform
data "haproxy-dataplane_backend" "api" {
  name = "be_api"
}

output "backend_mode" {
  value = data.haproxy-dataplane_backend.api.spec["mode"]
}
```

This is commonly used to wire outputs and policy checks without taking ownership of the backend resource.
