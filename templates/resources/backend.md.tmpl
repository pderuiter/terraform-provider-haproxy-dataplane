# haproxy-dataplane_backend (Resource)

Use this resource to create a backend and define balancing behavior.

## Example Usage

### API backend with round-robin balancing

Use this for stateless services where you want even request distribution across servers.

```terraform
resource "haproxy-dataplane_backend" "api" {
  name = "be_api"

  spec = {
    mode = "http"
    balance = {
      algorithm = "roundrobin"
    }
  }
}
```

### Backend with health checks and retry tuning

Use this for production APIs where connection behavior and retry handling must be explicit.

```terraform
resource "haproxy-dataplane_backend" "payments" {
  name = "be_payments"

  spec = {
    mode          = "http"
    retries       = 3
    server_timeout = 30000
    connect_timeout = 5000

    balance = {
      algorithm = "leastconn"
    }
  }
}
```

`connect_timeout`, `server_timeout`, and `retries` are common first tuning knobs during incident response.

## Notes

- Create `haproxy-dataplane_backend_server` resources to attach servers to this backend.
- Use `parent_name = haproxy-dataplane_backend.<name>.name` when creating child resources.
