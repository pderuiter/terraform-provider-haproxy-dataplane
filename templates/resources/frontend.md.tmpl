# haproxy-dataplane_frontend (Resource)

Use this resource to define request entry points and routing behavior.

## Example Usage

### HTTP frontend routing to a backend

Use this as the default edge routing pattern for internal APIs and web apps.

```terraform
resource "haproxy-dataplane_backend" "api" {
  name = "be_api"

  spec = {
    mode = "http"
    balance = {
      algorithm = "roundrobin"
    }
  }
}

resource "haproxy-dataplane_frontend" "public" {
  name = "fe_public"

  spec = {
    mode            = "http"
    default_backend = haproxy-dataplane_backend.api.name
  }
}
```

### Frontend with request logging enabled

Enable this when you need better request visibility for troubleshooting and traffic analysis.

```terraform
resource "haproxy-dataplane_frontend" "public" {
  name = "fe_public"

  spec = {
    mode     = "http"
    httplog  = true
    maxconn  = 20000
  }
}
```

`httplog` is useful in non-trivial environments where access logs feed centralized observability.

## Notes

- Add one or more `haproxy-dataplane_frontend_bind` resources to expose listeners.
- Use backend switching rules for path or host based routing.
